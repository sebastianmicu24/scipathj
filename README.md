## System Architecture

The architecture of SciPathJ is built on modern software engineering principles, emphasizing modularity, testability, and maintainability. The system avoids Singleton patterns in favor of a centralized **Application Context** that manages object lifecycles and handles **Dependency Injection (DI)**.

### Advanced Voronoi Tessellation Implementation

SciPathJ features an advanced Voronoi tessellation implementation specifically designed for accurate cytoplasm segmentation in histopathological images:

- **Point-Based Seeds**: Uses individual nucleus center coordinates as Voronoi seeds rather than filled regions, ensuring each nucleus gets its own distinct seed point.
- **Touching Nuclei Handling**: Properly separates touching nuclei with perpendicular bisector boundaries, eliminating overlapping ROI regions.
- **Performance Optimized**: Streamlined algorithm that processes 1992+ nuclei efficiently without complex distance calculations.
- **Mathematically Correct**: Implements the fundamental Voronoi principle where each seed point generates its own Voronoi cell with proper geometric boundaries.

This approach ensures accurate cell segmentation even in dense tissue regions where nuclei frequently touch or overlap, providing reliable cytoplasm ROI generation for downstream analysis.

### Advanced ROI Architecture v2.0

SciPathJ features a completely redesigned ROI (Region of Interest) system that addresses the limitations of traditional singleton patterns and provides robust separation of concerns across the three main application functions: Analysis, Dataset Creation, and Visualization.

#### Key Architectural Improvements

## H&E Color Deconvolution

SciPathJ includes a high-performance implementation of H&E color deconvolution based on the Ruifrok & Johnston method, identical to Fiji's Color Deconvolution plugin.

### Features
- **Ultra-fast Processing**: Optimized matrix operations with pre-computed inverse matrices
- **Standard Stain Vectors**: Uses identical vectors as Fiji for guaranteed compatibility
- **Three Channel Output**: Hematoxylin, Eosin, and Background channels
- **Direct Pixel Access**: Bypasses ImageJ overhead for maximum performance

### Algorithm
The deconvolution process follows these steps:
1. **RGB to Optical Density**: Convert RGB values to optical density using `OD = -log10(RGB/255.0)`
2. **Matrix Multiplication**: Apply the inverse stain matrix to separate stains
3. **Back to RGB**: Convert optical densities back to transmittance values

### Stain Matrix
```
Hematoxylin: [0.650, 0.704, 0.286] (Red, Green, Blue)
Eosin:       [0.072, 0.990, 0.105] (Red, Green, Blue)
Background:  [0.000, 0.000, 0.000] (computed as cross product)
```

### Usage Example
```java
// Create deconvolution instance
HEDeconvolution deconvolution = new HEDeconvolution(image);

// Perform deconvolution
deconvolution.performDeconvolution();

// Get individual channels
ImagePlus hematoxylin = deconvolution.getHematoxylinImage();
ImagePlus eosin = deconvolution.getEosinImage();
ImagePlus background = deconvolution.getBackgroundImage();
```

### Testing
Run the test to verify deconvolution works correctly:
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.scipath.scipathj.core.analysis.HEDeconvolutionTest
```

### Documentation
For detailed technical information, see [`HE_DECONVOLUTION.md`](HE_DECONVOLUTION.md).

## Development

The project adheres to professional Java development guidelines to ensure a high-quality, maintainable, and extensible codebase.

### Development Environment

- **Recommended IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
- **Useful Plugins**:
  - Maven Integration
  - Git Integration
  - SonarLint / Checkstyle

### Architectural Principles

The codebase is built upon the **SOLID** principles:
- **(S)ingle Responsibility Principle**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **(O)pen/Closed Principle**: Software entities are open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **(L)iskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes are substitutable for their base types.
- **(I)nterface Segregation Principle**: Clients are not forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **(D)ependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions. Dependency Injection is used throughout the application.

### Coding Practices
- **Immutability**: Data-carrying classes are implemented as immutable Java Records where possible.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: JavaDoc for all public classes and methods.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Specific, custom exceptions are used instead of generic ones.
- **Unit Testing**: JUnit 5 with Mockito for creating robust and isolated tests.

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Compile and run all tests
mvn clean test

# Run code quality analysis
mvn spotbugs:check pmd:check

# Generate test coverage report
mvn jacoco:report
```
