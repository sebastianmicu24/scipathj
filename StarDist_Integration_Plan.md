# StarDist Integration Plan - ✅ COMPLETED

## ✅ Problem Resolution Summary

**ORIGINAL ISSUES (RESOLVED)**:
- ~~**Incorrect Command Execution**: Current implementation uses `IJ.run("StarDist2D", params)` which fails with "Unrecognized command: StarDist2D"~~ ✅ **FIXED**
- ~~**Plugin Recognition Failure**: StarDist is not being recognized as an available ImageJ command because it's implemented as a SciJava plugin~~ ✅ **FIXED**
- ~~**Zero Detection Results**: The error shows 0 nuclei detected because StarDist isn't executing properly~~ ✅ **FIXED**
